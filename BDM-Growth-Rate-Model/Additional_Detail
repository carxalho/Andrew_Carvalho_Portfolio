## 📈 BDM Growth Rate Model – Strategic Revenue Forecasting Tool

### Overview
Engaged directly by the Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) under NDA (now lifted), I led the development of a parametric forecasting model designed to simulate and optimize revenue targets for Business Development Managers (BDMs) and Account Managers across global divisions. This model served as a strategic planning tool during a critical phase of organizational restructuring.

### Business Challenge
The CRO required a dynamic solution to model revenue growth scenarios based on multiple operational variables, including headcount, churn rate, rehire velocity, budget constraints, and YoY growth expectations. The goal was to enable data-driven experimentation and planning for both existing and future sales teams.

### Approach & Execution

#### 🔹 Data Acquisition & Preparation
- Collaborated cross-functionally with HR, Finance, Sales, and Operations to source headcount, revenue, and projection data segmented by region and division.
- Developed robust SQL scripts to:
  - Perform data quality checks (e.g., deduplication, null handling, formatting corrections).
  - Normalize and join disparate datasets into a unified master table.
  - Generate current-year metrics and 3-year forward-looking projections.

#### 🔹 Model Design in Excel
- Imported the cleansed dataset into Excel and designed a modular interface with a dedicated control panel tab for input variables.
- Enabled dynamic scenario modeling using formulas and lookup logic for:
  - Churn rate
  - Rehire rate
  - Ramp-up efficiency (time-to-productivity curves)
  - Budget allocation
  - Revenue targets

#### 🔹 Visualization & Calibration
- Created dual-line revenue plots:
  - One line representing existing revenue projections.
  - One line representing model-generated forecasts.
- Iteratively tuned input parameters to align the model output with strategic targets, enabling the CRO to identify optimal hiring and investment strategies.

### Tools & Technologies
- SQL Server – Data cleansing, transformation, and aggregation
- Excel (Advanced) – Parametric modeling, scenario simulation, and visualization
- Stakeholder Collaboration – Cross-departmental coordination and executive engagement

### Impact
- Provided the CRO with a flexible, data-driven tool for strategic headcount and revenue planning.
- Enabled rapid scenario testing and sensitivity analysis, improving confidence in budget and hiring decisions.
- The model was adopted as a core asset in quarterly planning cycles and contributed to more accurate forecasting and resource allocation.
