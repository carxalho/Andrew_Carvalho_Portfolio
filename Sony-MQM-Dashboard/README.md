# Sony MQM Dashboard Automation

## Objective
Automate and enhance monthly MQM scorecard reporting for Sony.

## Approach
- Built an SSIS pipeline to ingest and transform manually submitted Excel scorecards.
- Applied data validation, deduplication, and computed columns using SQL and CTEs.
- Created two Sisense dashboards:
  - Summary Dashboard: Aggregated metrics like word count, error types, and scores.
  - Trend Dashboard: Analyzed translation KPIs across language pairs.

## Tools Used
SSIS, SQL Server, Sisense, Excel

## Impact
Reduced manual processing time, improved data accuracy, and enabled Sony to monitor translation quality trends across languages more effectively.
